# ABP Browser Control Guide

## How ABP Works

ABP **pauses JavaScript and virtual time** between your actions. The page is frozen until your next tool call.

When you call any action tool (browser_action, browser_scroll, browser_navigate, etc.):
1. ABP **resumes** JS execution
2. ABP dispatches your action(s)
3. ABP **waits ~500ms** for the page to settle (rendering, network, scripts)
4. ABP captures a **screenshot** automatically
5. ABP **re-pauses** JS execution
6. You receive the response with the screenshot

**One tool call = one complete turn.** Screenshots are included automatically with every action response. There is no need to take a separate screenshot after performing an action.

## Batching Actions

`browser_action` accepts 1-3 actions per call. Batch common workflows to reduce round-trips:

- **Click, type, submit:** `[{mouse_click, x, y}, {keyboard_type, text}, {keyboard_press, key: ENTER}]`
- **Click and type:** `[{mouse_click, x, y}, {keyboard_type, text}]`
- **Single click:** `[{mouse_click, x, y}]`

Actions execute sequentially with a 20ms pause between each. One screenshot is taken after all actions complete.

**Do NOT batch scrolling** — use `browser_scroll` separately.

## Waiting for Slow Content

Sometimes 500ms isn't enough for the page to finish loading (AJAX, animations, redirects). When the screenshot shows incomplete content:

**Call `browser_screenshot` to wait and observe.** It runs the same resume-wait-capture-pause cycle without performing any action, giving the page another chance to settle. Repeat until the content appears.

## Markup Overlays

Pass `markup` to `browser_screenshot` to see visual overlays on the page. Available overlays:

- **`clickable`** — Green outlines around clickable elements (links, buttons, onclick handlers)
- **`typeable`** — Orange outlines around text inputs and textareas
- **`scrollable`** — Purple dashed outlines around scrollable containers
- **`selected`** — Blue outline around the currently focused element
- **`grid`** — Red coordinate grid at 100px intervals with viewport coordinate labels

Use `grid` to map viewport coordinates for targeting clicks. Use `clickable` and `typeable` to identify interactive elements visually.

## Tool Reference (15 tools)

All `tab_id` parameters are optional and default to the active tab.

**Input:**
- `browser_action` — 1-3 actions: mouse_click (x, y), keyboard_type (text), keyboard_press (key, modifiers?), mouse_hover (x, y), mouse_drag (start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y). Keys are ALL-CAPS (ENTER, TAB, ESCAPE, CONTROL, META, etc.). Abbreviations accepted: CTRL, CMD, ESC, DEL.
- `browser_scroll` — x, y (where wheel fires), delta_x?, delta_y? (positive=down/right)
- `browser_slider` — orientation (horizontal/vertical), track bounds, current position, min, max, target_value. Calculates and executes drag automatically.

**Navigation:**
- `browser_navigate` — url? OR action? (back, forward, reload)
- `browser_tabs` — action? (list, new, close, info, activate, stop; default: list), tab_id?, url?

**Observation:**
- `browser_screenshot` — markup?, disable_markup?, format?
- `browser_javascript` — expression (required). Data extraction and DOM inspection ONLY — do NOT use for interaction; prefer browser_action.
- `browser_text` — selector?

**Situational:**
- `browser_dialog` — action? (check, accept, dismiss; default: check), prompt_text?
- `browser_downloads` — action? (list, status, cancel, content; default: list), download_id?, state?, limit?, max_size?
- `browser_files` — chooser_id (required), files?, content_files?, path?, cancel?
- `browser_select_picker` — Respond to pending select/dropdown popups

**Browser:**
- `browser_get_status` — no params
- `browser_shutdown` — timeout_ms?

## Debugging

Use `browser_get_status` to check if the browser is ready and connected.

Session data (history database, screenshots) is stored in a session directory. To find the paths, query the REST API:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8222/api/v1/browser/session-data
```

The session directory contains:
```
<session_dir>/
├── history.db           # SQLite database with sessions, actions, events
└── screenshots/         # Auto-saved before/after WebP screenshots per action
```

Query the database:
```sql
-- Recent actions
SELECT id, type, status, url, error FROM actions ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10;
-- Events for an action
SELECT * FROM events WHERE action_id = <id>;
-- Screenshot paths
SELECT screenshot_before_path, screenshot_after_path FROM actions WHERE id = <id>;
```

## Tips

- `browser_javascript` uses `expression` as its parameter name (not `script`)
- `browser_scroll` requires `x`, `y` coordinates where the mouse wheel fires — target the element center
- Scroll direction: `delta_y` positive = scroll down, negative = scroll up
- JS is paused between actions — timers and animations don't advance until your next tool call
- Key names are ALL-CAPS: ENTER, TAB, ESCAPE, BACKSPACE, ARROWUP, ARROWDOWN, etc.
- Modifier keys for keyboard_press: SHIFT, CONTROL, ALT, META (or abbreviations CTRL, CMD, OPT)
